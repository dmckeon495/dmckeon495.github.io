DAN MCKEON PORTFOLIO PAGE

1. OVERVIEW

This is a webpage serving as my personal portfolio page. It includes a clear picture of me, a third-person bio, links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages, and a couple of projects I've worked on during the bootcamp.

2. FEATURES

The website runs using the Bulma CSS framework, which allows for tiles that I used in the about me section to make things look a little more modern and less stuffy than what I've been able to do with Bootstrap. Minimal JavaScript code was utilized so that the navbar can have a mobile burger menu.

The portfolio section includes three projects to showcase my variety: our group project, a homework assignment, and a side project I've been working on. Each shows a different aspect of my coding skills and gives some more flavor that hopefully will help me stand out.
